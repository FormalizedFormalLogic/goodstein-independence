/-! ## The f-slot elimination suite

The number-theoretic operator slot `f : ℕ → ℕ` is what a plain numeric stage counter cannot be:
the ℕ-stage judgment `Zeh` cannot carry the running-family reduction
(`principal_witness_exceeds_stage`: the `exI` witness `n ≤ hardy e m > m` cannot be lowered to
the output stage).  The fix is the function-slot judgment `Zef`: the ℕ-stage `m` is replaced by
the slot `f`, and the running-family reduction (`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`) and step motive
(`stepAllω_Zf`) are discharged there as real theorems.  The f-slot enters the elimination
lemmas as:

* **composition at principal cuts** — the reduction's output slot is `f ∘ g` of the premises';
* **max-relativization at ω-nodes** — `rel1 f n = fun x => f (max n x)`;
* **`hardy e` at the root** — `NormControlled` collapses to `hardy e` when `m = 0`.

The reduction/step statements stay at FIXED control with the composed slot; ALL ordinal collapse
and numeric iteration is confined to the (unfinished) rank-lowering pass `cutElimPass_Zf`, where
the control `e` is untouched — the ordinal collapses (`collapse α`) and the slot iterates
(`iterSlot f α`).

/-- **Norm control** (the number-theoretic operator bound, tied to the `(e, m)` axis):
`f` dominates the Hardy witness bound at every relativization depth.  `hardy e` is the root
instantiation (`normControlled_root`); the ω-node re-entry is `normControlled_rel1`.

/-- **Seam 2 in controlled form — the ω-node re-entry** (real proof): a controlled slot,
relativized at branch `n` and run at the max-adjoined stage, is controlled by `rel1 f n`.
This is `rel1_comp`'s semantic payload: the branch-unbounded demand that overflowed every
`Zekd` `d`-slot re-enters through ONE function slot's relativization. -/

/-- Norm control is antitone in the stage: a slot controlling stage `m` controls any
smaller stage `m' ≤ m` (the `exI` bound only shrinks).  Reused when the reduction runs a
premise at a lower stage than the conclusion. -/

/-- **Composition preserves control at a fixed control** (the numeric update `f ↦ f∘g` at the
*same* control, [EW12, Lemma 25]).  If `g` controls `e` at `m` and `f` is inflationary
(condition `(f.1)`: `2y+1 ≤ f y ⟹ y ≤ f y`), then the composed slot `f ∘ g` still controls `e`
at `m`.  Note: this is the *fixed*-control fact; the *raised*-control demand belongs to
`cutElimPass_Zf`'s pinned iterate, not here. -/
theorem NormControlled.comp {f g : ℕ → ℕ} {e : ONote} {m : ℕ}

  fun x => le_trans (hg x) (hf (g x))

/-- **The reduction's composed-slot conjunct** (`NormControlled (f∘g) e m`, at fixed control).
From `g` controlled at any stage `m₀` and `f` controlled at the output stage `m`, the composed
slot `f ∘ g` is controlled at `m`.  Unlike `NormControlled.comp` this needs no separate
inflationarity hypothesis on `f`: control of `g` already forces `g` inflationary
(`x ≤ max m₀ x ≤ hardy e (max m₀ x) ≤ g x`, via `le_hardy`), and then
`f (g x) ≥ hardy e (max m (g x)) ≥ hardy e (max m x)` (`hf` at `g x`, `hardy_monotone`). -/

/-- **Kernel witness for the stage-`m` reduction gap.**  A stage-`m` reduction has a
principal-`exI` case where the witness satisfies only `n ≤ hardy e m`, which strictly exceeds
the stage `m` at any nontrivial control — e.g. `hardy ω m = 2m+1 > m`.  So `n ≤ hardy e m` does
not give `n ≤ m`, and the family member `fam n` (stage `max m₀ n`) cannot be lowered to the
output stage `m` (`Zeh` has no stage-lowering rule). -/

/-! ## The numeric-slot iterate bricks ([EW12, Definition 16] carriers)

`Function.iterate` (`f^[k]`) is the `k`-fold composition; it preserves exactly the operator
conditions the reduction threads (monotone, inflationary, `NormControlled`) and composes to
iterates (`iter_comp`: counts add — the `∃`-cut lane).  These are the numeric carrier the
ordinal-indexed iterate `iterSlot` (below) is built on.

/-! ## The collapse and the ordinal-indexed iterate

Relating a rank-`c+1` derivation to a rank-`c` one needs collapsing the ordinal and iterating
the slot.  Two explicit `ONote`-grounded definitions:

- `collapse α := ω^α` (`expTower`) — one rank-collapsing step; iterated `c` times it is the
  rank-lowering tower `Ω_c(α) = Ω^{Ω_{c-1}(α)}`.  NF-preserving + strictly monotone (the descent
  the collapse induction needs) — both proven below, reusing `expTower_NF`/`expTower_lt_expTower`.
- `iterSlot f α` — the **diagonalizing** ordinal-indexed iterate.  Its ROLE matches
  [EW12, Definition 16]'s `f^α`, but its IMPLEMENTATION differs: [EW12]'s `f^α` is a norm-bounded
  transfinite recursion, whereas `iterSlot` is defined by the same fundamental-sequence recursion
  as this repo's `hardy` — a Hardy-style variant [BW87, p. 181]: base `iterSlot f 0 = f`,
  successor `iterSlot f (a+1) n = iterSlot f a (f n)`, limit `iterSlot f λ n = iterSlot f (λ[n]) n`.
  On finite ordinals it agrees with the fixed-count form (`iterSlot f (ofNat k) = f^[k+1]`); at
  limits it diagonalizes — the branch index rides the numeric argument, which `rel1` raises
  (`rel1 (iterSlot f α) n` evaluates the ordinal index at `α[max n x]`-stages, absorbing
  branch-growing budgets).

**Why `iterSlot` must diagonalize.**  A fixed-count definition `iterSlot f α := f^[norm α + 1]`
is refuted at the `allω` reassembly: the branch `n` needs output slot `(rel1 f n)^[norm (β n) + 1]`
while the parent forces branch slot `rel1 (f^[norm α + 1]) n`; `Zef.mono_f` only raises slots, so
reassembly needs `(rel1 f n)^[norm (β n) + 1] ≤ rel1 (f^[norm α + 1]) n` pointwise.  Counterexample
at `α = ω`, `β 2 = ofNat 2`, `f = hardy ω`, `x = 0`: parent side `f^[2] 2 = 11 < 23 = (rel1 f 2)^[3] 0`.
Root cause: `norm` is not monotone along `<` (`norm (ofNat n) = n` grows along ω's fundamental
sequence while `norm ω = 1`), so no fixed ℕ-count read off the parent ordinal dominates the
branches — the diagonalization is forced.

/-- **`iterSlot`** — the diagonalizing ordinal-indexed numeric-slot iterate.  Its role matches
[EW12, Definition 16]'s `f^α`, but its implementation is a Hardy-style fundamental-sequence
variant [BW87, p. 181]: `iterSlot f 0 = f`; `iterSlot f (a+1) n = iterSlot f a (f n)`;
`iterSlot f λ n = iterSlot f (λ[n]) n` (limit, via `ONote.fundamentalSequence`).  Same well-founded
recursion as `hardy`; `hardy` is `iterSlot` of the successor, up to the base case. -/
