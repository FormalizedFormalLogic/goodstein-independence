/-- **Index domination — the A4 core, proved axiom-clean.** Once a tower level has overtaken
`o` (`o < tower n`), it strictly dominates `o` at the diagonal argument:
`f_o(n) < f_{tower n}(n)`, for `n ≥ 2` past `norm o`. The full Bachmann reachability strength
(`reaches_of_lt`: `tower n` reaches the successor of `o` with budget `n`, generalizing
`fastGrowing_bachmann_reach` from consecutive indices to arbitrary `α < β`) plus one strict
successor step (`fastGrowing_lt_succ_index`). The growth gap of Kirby–Paris independence. -/

hierarchy is eventually strictly dominated by `fastGrowingε₀`. Reduced (axiom-clean modulo
the index-domination core) to `tower_cofinal` + `fastGrowing_lt_of_lt_tower`: pick `k` with
`o < tower k`; for `n ≥ max k 1`, `o < tower k ≤ tower n`, so `f_o(n) < f_{tower n}(n) =
