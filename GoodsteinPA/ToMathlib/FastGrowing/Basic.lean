# Growth theory of the fast-growing hierarchy

`Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Notation` already provides the **fast-growing hierarchy**
on ordinal notations below `ε₀`:

* `ONote.fastGrowing : ONote → ℕ → ℕ`  with `f₀ = succ`, `f_{α+1} = fun n => f_α^[n] n`,
  `f_λ = fun n => f_{λ[n]} n` (limit `λ`, via `ONote.fundamentalSequence`);
* `ONote.fastGrowingε₀ : ℕ → ℕ`, the one-step extension to `ε₀` itself.

mathlib proves the *small values* (`fastGrowing_one = (2 * ·)`, `fastGrowing_two = fun n => 2^n * n`,
`fastGrowingε₀_zero = 1`, `fastGrowingε₀_one = 2`) but **none of the growth theory**:
no expansiveness, no monotonicity, no domination. Those are exactly the facts the
Kirby–Paris growth argument needs, and they are the targets here.

These lemmas are mathlib-PR-shaped (they belong next to `ONote.fastGrowing`); developing
them here both serves the Goodstein-independence growth content and is independently useful.

## Normal-form hypotheses
`fastGrowing` is total on all of `ONote`, but the intended (and provable) statements
hold for **normal-form** notations (`ONote.NF`). Carry `[o.NF]`/`(h : o.NF)` where the
proof needs it; the `fundamentalSequence` correctness lemmas
(`ONote.fundamentalSequence_has_prop`, `ONote.FundamentalSequenceProp`) and the
`fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit` characterizations are the entry points.
-/



/-- **Expansiveness.** Every level of the fast-growing hierarchy dominates the
identity: `n ≤ f_o(n)` for every notation `o` (no normal-form hypothesis needed —
`fundamentalSequence_has_prop` holds for all `o`).

Proof by well-founded recursion on `o` (the same `<`-recursion that *defines*
`fastGrowing`), via the three characterizations `fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit`:
* `o = 0`: `f_o = Nat.succ`, so `n ≤ n+1`.
* successor `o = a+1`: `f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n`; by IH `id ≤ f_a`, and iterating a
  function that dominates the identity stays `≥ id` (`id_le_iterate_of_id_le`).
* limit: `f_o n = f_{o[n]} n` with `o[n] < o`, so the IH applies directly. -/

/-! ### Structural Bachmann reachability — the A3 crux, fully proved

The remaining difficulty in index monotonicity is now a pure statement about
`fundamentalSequence`: the descent of `o[n+1]` (budget `n+1`) passes exactly through
`o[n]`. We prove it by structural recursion on `o`, assembling four reusable facts:
`reaches_zero` (every notation descends to 0), `Reaches.oadd_tail` (descend a fixed
prefix's tail), `reaches_coeff_step'`/`reaches_coeff_chain` (drop a leading coefficient),
and `reaches_omega_pow_lift` (lift an exponent reach through `ω^·`). -/

/-- **Descend a fixed prefix's tail.** A structural reach on the tail lifts to the whole

it lifts via `fundamentalSequence_oadd_succ`/`fundamentalSequence_oadd_limit`. -/

/-- **The Bachmann reachability crux (A3, structural form) — PROVEN, axiom-clean**
(`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`; body below is a complete structural recursion on `o`, no `sorry`).

For a limit notation `o` with fundamental sequence `f`, the *next* index `f (n+1)`
structurally reaches the *current* index `f n` with budget `n+1`:
`Reaches (n+1) (f (n+1)) (f n)`.

This is the **Bachmann property** of the standard CNF fundamental sequences: the descent
of `f (n+1)` (at the fixed index `n+1`) passes *exactly* through `f n` — because the
`ONote` fundamental sequence descends tails first and the coefficients pass through every
integer value, so no tail "overshoots". From it, *all* index monotonicity of the
fast-growing hierarchy follows via `fastGrowing_le_of_reaches` (see `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step`).

The proof is a structural recursion on `o` (leading-term cases via `reaches_coeff_step'`;
`ω^{limit}` residue via `reaches_omega_pow_lift`; limit-tail via `Reaches.oadd_tail`). This
replaced the old analytic `sorry`; the successor-chain and `ω^2` cases are the specialisations
`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ` / `fastGrowing_omega_sq_…`. -/

the index step is just `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`. This covers every limit of the form
`β + ω` (e.g. `ω, ω·k, ω+k`), whose fundamental sequence increments a finite tail.

Consequently the remaining genuine difficulty in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step` lives
*only* at limits-of-limits (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …), where `f n` is itself a limit and the
chain is not successor-stepwise — that is the sharp residue of the A3 crux. -/

diagonal `n ↦ (f_a)^[n] n`. (The successor companion of `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`, at the

/-- **Monotonicity for successor-chain limits — the general engine, axiom-clean.**
If `o` is a limit whose fundamental sequence `f` is a *successor chain*
(`fundamentalSequence (f (k+1)) = inl (some (f k))`), then `f_o` is monotone *provided
only the bottom level `f 0` is monotone*: monotonicity of every `f k` then follows from
`fastGrowing_monotone_succ` along the chain, and the limit step is discharged by
`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`.

This is the clean companion to `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`: it lifts the *index
step* to the whole `Monotone` predicate, and covers every `β + ω`-type limit (`ω`, `ω·k`,
`β+ω`) in one stroke. The genuinely hard residue (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …) — where the
fundamental sequence is not a successor chain — remains in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step`. -/

notation-successor of `ω·j`; so monotonicity propagates up the `ω·k` ladder by induction

`ω·(n+2)` descends *at index `n+1`* to `ω·(n+1) + (n+2)`, which **is** reachable from
`ω·(n+1)` by a finite successor chain of length `n+2`. So the index step collapses to
`fastGrowing_succ_chain_mono` after one limit unfolding — the concrete realization of the

# A4 — `fastGrowingε₀` dominates every fixed level (the headline domination crux)

The unboundedness that *is* the Goodstein/Kirby–Paris independence content:

> For every notation `o < ε₀`, eventually `fastGrowing o n < fastGrowingε₀ n`.

`fastGrowingε₀` is `mathlib`'s one-step extension of the fast-growing hierarchy to `ε₀`,
built on the *diagonal tower* fundamental sequence `0, 1, ω, ω^ω, ω^ω^ω, …` converging to
`ε₀`:

* `fastGrowingε₀ i = fastGrowing (tower i) i`, where `tower i = (fun a => ω^a)^[i] 0`.

This file pins the tower structure and **proves A4 in full, axiom-clean**. With
A1 (`le_fastGrowing`), A2 (`fastGrowing_monotone`) and A3 (`fastGrowing_bachmann_reach`)
proved in `Basic.lean`, the remaining content of A4 was an **index domination** fact: each
fixed `o` is eventually outgrown because the tower indices climb past it.

## Architecture (all proved, no `sorry`)
1. **Tower structure**: `tower (i+1) = ω^{tower i}`, `fastGrowingε₀` unfolds to
   `fastGrowing (tower i) i`; cofinality `tower_cofinal`.
2. **The CNF norm** `norm` + the **key cofinality bound**
   `lt_fundamentalSequence_of_norm_le` (THE new theorem): for a limit `β` and `α < β` with
   `norm α ≤ x`, already `α < g_β(x)`. Proved by structural induction over all six
   `fundamentalSequence` branches.
3. **General reachability** `reaches_of_lt`: `α < β ∧ norm α ≤ x ⟹ Reaches x β α`, by WF
   recursion on `β` reusing (2) at limits.
4. **Strictness** via the notation successor `osucc`: reach `osucc o` and take one strict
   successor index step (`fastGrowing_lt_succ_index`, needs `2 ≤ n`).

Headline: `fastGrowing_lt_fastGrowingε₀` — every fixed `f_o` is eventually strictly
dominated by `f_{ε₀}`. This is the unboundedness that *is* the Kirby–Paris growth gap.
