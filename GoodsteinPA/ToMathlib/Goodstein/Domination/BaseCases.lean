# `GoodsteinLike` sequences and the self-similarity TOWER

Lap 9 found the winning idea — **self-similarity**: the leading-exponent sequence
`L_k = log_{base k}(G_k)` of a Goodstein descent is *itself* a Goodstein-like descent, so it
dominates the genuine Goodstein sequence seeded at `L_0 = log₂ m`. Lap 10 closed `o = ω` by iterating
that idea once. This file extracts the idea into its **clean reusable abstraction** and proves the
*fully iterated* form, the engine for climbing the ordinal tower toward `f_{ε₀}`.

A sequence `a : ℕ → ℕ` is `GoodsteinLike` when it obeys the Goodstein lower-bound recursion
`a (k+1) ≥ bump (base k) (a k) − 1` at every step (the genuine `goodsteinSeq` obeys it with equality).
Two structural facts hold for every such sequence:

* **`GoodsteinLike.dominates`** — `a` dominates `goodsteinSeq (a 0)` (self-similarity: the recursion
  with the `−1` firing at every step is the slowest, so `goodsteinSeq (a 0)` is a lower envelope).
* **`GoodsteinLike.logSeq`** — `k ↦ log_{base k} (a k)` is again `GoodsteinLike` (the leading exponent
  of a Goodstein-like sequence is Goodstein-like — the level-up that drives the tower).

Iterating the second fact (`GoodsteinLike.iterate`) and feeding the first gives the headline
**`iterLeadExp_dominates`**: the `j`-fold iterated leading exponent of the seed-`m` descent dominates
the Goodstein sequence seeded at the `j`-fold logarithm `(log₂)^[j] m`. For `j = 0` this is the value
itself; `j = 1` is lap-9's `leadExp_ge_goodsteinSeq_log`; each higher `j` is one ordinal level up
(`o = ω^j`-flavoured), the precise self-reference behind Cichoń's lower bound at the limit levels.
-/


/-- **General per-step log descent.** For any `n`, the leading exponent obeys the Goodstein recursion
as a *lower bound*: `bump b (log_b n) − 1 ≤ log_{b+1} (bump b n − 1)`. Off pure powers it is an
equality at `bump b (log_b n)` (`log_bump_pred_of_not_pow`); at a pure power it drops by exactly one
(`log_bump_pred_of_pow`); when `n = 0` both sides are `0`. Generalizes `leadExp_step_ge` from the
concrete Goodstein value to an arbitrary `n` — the brick that makes `log ∘ a` Goodstein-like. -/

* `j ≥ 2`: each level is one ordinal step up. To certify the descent ordinal `≥ ω^{ω^{···}}` (tower
  of height `j+1`, i.e. `o = ω^j`-flavoured) at step `≈ m`, one needs the `j`-th iterated leading
  exponent `≥ base` there, which via this bound needs `goodsteinSeq ((log₂)^[j] m) (m−2) ≥ m`, i.e. a
  length bound `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[j] m) ≥ 2m`. The deeper seed `(log₂)^[j] m` is small, so this
  needs an increasingly strong length bound — supplied by *bootstrapping the domination already
  proved* (e.g. `f_ω(t) ≤ goodsteinLength t + 2` makes `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[2] m) ≥ f_ω(log₂log₂m)

# Cichoń's lower bound at finite levels: the unconditional closure

`Logic/Goodstein/Domination.lean` reduces the diagonal domination
`fastGrowing (ofNat n) m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2` to **one** self-referential length bound
`goodsteinLength m ≥ 2^{m+1} + m` (`goodsteinLength_exp_lower`), via the self-similarity recursion
`leadExp_ge_goodsteinSeq_log` (the leading-exponent sequence dominates the Goodstein sequence one
scale down). That strong induction needs finitely many computational base cases — the seeds
`4 ≤ M < 16`, where the length must already be exponentially large. This file discharges them
**kernel-only** (lap 211): `le_bump` bounds the per-step drop by 1, so a checkpoint value `v` at
step `k` certifies `goodsteinLength ≥ k + v` (`glen_ge_of_seq_value`); every seed reaches the
needed `2^{M+1}+M` by step `k ≤ 4`, and the checkpoint is evaluated in the kernel by the fuel-based
structural evaluator `gvalF`/`bumpF`. The formerly-needed `native_decide` forward passes (heaviest:
a 65551-step pass for `M = 15`) are gone, so the unconditional theorems below sit on the standard
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` with NO `Lean.ofReduceBool`.

# Toward `o = ω`: the limit-level diagonal, isolated to its crux

With the finite-level diagonal `f_n(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2` closed
(`DominationBaseCases.lean`), the next tier of Cichoń's lower bound is the **limit ordinal `ω`**:
`f_ω(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`. This file builds the ordinal bridge for `ω^ω` and reduces the
`o = ω` diagonal to a single open hypothesis — exactly the way `Domination.lean`'s
`goodstein_dominates_of_index` framed the finite levels in lap 6.

The crux it isolates: the descent's **leading exponent stays in the LARGE regime** (`≥ base`) at step
`m − 2`. For finite `o = n` we only needed `leadExp ≥ n` (a fixed constant); for `o = ω` we need
`leadExp ≥ base = m`, i.e. the leading exponent itself reaches `ω` at the ordinal level. This is one
recursion deeper than the lap-9 self-similarity (see `PENDING_WORK.md` → "NEXT FRONTIER"), and is the
genuine remaining growth content — NOT to be axiomatized.

/-- **The general ordinal bridge (unifies every level).** For any ordinal `β`, if the descent's
leading CNF exponent ordinal `toOrdinal (base i) (leadExp_i)` dominates `β`, then the descent ordinal
dominates `ω^β`: `ω^β ≤ (seqONote m i).repr`. Just `opow_le_opow_right` (monotonicity of `ω^·`) chained
with `opow_toOrdinal_log_le` (the leading term `ω^{toOrdinal b (log_b v)}` is `≤ toOrdinal b v`). Every
level-specific bridge below (`ω^k`, `ω^ω`, `ω^{ω^j}`, `ω^{ω^ω}`) is this lemma fed a `toOrdinal` lower

/-- **THE `o = ω` DIAGONAL DOMINATION — UNCONDITIONAL (every `m ≥ 2^16`):**
`fastGrowing ω m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`, i.e. `f_ω(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`, with
`ω = oadd 1 1 0`. This is Cichoń's lower bound at the **first limit ordinal** — the leading CNF
exponent of the Goodstein descent provably reaches `ω` (the LARGE regime `≥ base`) and stays there
through step `m − 2`, so the descent ordinal dominates `ω^ω`.

The crux `hreg` (leading exponent `≥ base (m−2) = m` at step `m − 2`) is discharged by **iterating
the self-similarity once more**: `leadExp_ge_goodsteinSeq_log` bounds the leading exponent below by
the *one-level-down* Goodstein value `goodsteinSeq (log₂ m) (m−2)`, and `n_le_goodsteinSeq` keeps that
value `≥ m` provided the one-level-down sequence still has `≥ m` steps to run — supplied by the
doubly-iterated length bound `two_mul_le_goodsteinLength_log` (`goodsteinLength (log₂ m) ≥ 2m − 2`).
For finite `o = n` the analog only needed value `≥ n` (a constant); the jump to `o = ω` is precisely
the jump from "value `≥ n`" to "value `≥ base = m`", which the *factor-of-two* surplus in the length
bound provides. The whole reduction is then closed by `fastGrowing_omega_le_goodsteinLength_of_largeRegime`. -/

/-! ### Discharging the `o = ω^j` crux: an `f_ω`-strength length bound at the deep seed

The sole remaining obligation is `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[2] m) ≥ m`. The exponential length bound is
far too weak at the doubly-iterated seed `t = (log₂)^[2] m` (it gives only `≈ 2^t`, while `m ≈ 2^{2^t}`).
But we now have `f_ω(t) ≤ goodsteinLength t + 2` — a *tower-strength* lower bound — and `f_ω` outgrows
`2^{2^{·}}`. Bootstrapping the `o = ω` result against itself closes the `o = ω^j` tier. -/

`fastGrowing (ω^ω) m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`, with `ω^ω = oadd (oadd 1 1 0) 1 0`. Cichoń's lower
bound at `ω^ω` — fully machine-checked. The crux is the SECOND leading exponent in the LARGE regime
(`secondLeadExp_{m-2} ≥ base(m-2) = m`), discharged by the tower (`iterLeadExp_dominates m 2`) +
`n_le_goodsteinSeq` (`n = m`) + the doubly-iterated length bound `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[2] m) ≥ 2m`
(`two_mul_le_goodsteinLength_loglog`, budget `(m−2)+m = 2m−2 ≤ 2m`). Carries the finite-base-case
