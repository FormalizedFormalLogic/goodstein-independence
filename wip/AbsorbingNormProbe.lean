# SERIES-2 Stage D-1 probe — a finite-fibered ABSORBING norm on `ONote`

**Question (the reserved top-rank-cut ruling's prime amendment candidate).**  The DIRECTION
lap-192 review reframed the top-rank-cut obstruction as a TRILEMMA and named its prime
judge-amendment candidate: a **finite-fibered ABSORBING** norm `N` with

  (i)  finite fibers  (`{α : N α ≤ K}` finite — i.e. a finite `ewBall`), and
  (ii) `N (α + γ) ≤ max (N α) (N γ) + O(1)`   (absorbing, NOT additive).

Such a norm dissolves the node gate `N (α+γ) ≤ g (f 0)` with essentially NO slot property:
`N(α+γ) ≤ max (N α)(N γ) + c ≤ max (g 0)(f 0) + c`, so the gate closes as soon as
`max (g 0)(f 0) + c ≤ g (f 0)` — a MASSIVELY weaker demand than the refuted base-additivity
`hg_base : ∀ k, g 0 + k ≤ g k`.  The lap-192 review CONJECTURED "finite fibers force
additivity-like growth (T-Z7(i))", i.e. NO such norm exists.

**This probe REFUTES that conjecture.**  The obstruction to `ewN` being absorbing is the
MERGE case of ordinal addition: `ω^β·n + ω^β·m = ω^β·(n+m)` (see `ONote.addAux`, the
`Ordering.eq → oadd e (n+n') a'` arm), where the coefficient ADDS.  `ewN` charges `n` linearly
(`ewN (oadd e n a) = ewN e + n + ewN a`), so a merge costs `min(n,m)` — unbounded.  The fix is
a **max-over-terms norm with a LOGARITHMIC coefficient charge**: `clog(n+m) ≤ max(clog n)(clog m)+1`
tames the merge, and the max-over-terms shape (instead of a sum) tames concatenation.

Deliverables (all kernel-checked; no `native_decide`):
  * `clog_add_le` — the merge lemma for the log coefficient charge (pure ℕ);
  * `Nlog` — the candidate norm; `Nlog_finite_fiber` — property (i) fully **PROVEN**
    (kernel-clean) on NF notations, with the NF restriction shown NECESSARY
    (`Nlog_fiber_infinite_without_NF`: non-NF flat chains give an infinite `Nlog ≤ 1` ball);
    plus the `Nlog_spine` growth witness on the tower spine (the family that makes `ewN`'s
    max-coefficient source-norm INfinite-fibered);
  * `nlog_absorbs_merge`, `nlog_absorbs_concat`, … — the absorbing inequality kernel-checked
    (`decide`) on the adversarial merge/concat pairs that REFUTE `ewN`/max-coeff;
  * `ewN_not_absorbing` — the concrete family where `ewN` violates absorption (contrast);
  * `Nlog_add_le_max_succ` — the GENERAL absorbing theorem, **PROVEN** (kernel-clean
    `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`): `Nlog (α+γ) ≤ max (Nlog α)(Nlog γ) + 1` for all
    NF `α, γ`, via ordinal-absorption `repr_inj` case analysis on the two leading exponents.

This is **wip-only ruling input** (SERIES-2 order Stage D-1 / ladder P2).  Nothing here touches
`src`; `ewN` and the ratified `rel1`/output pillars are UNCHANGED.

/-! ## Finite-fiber witnesses

`Nlog` has finite fibers, but for a SUBTLER reason than `ewN`.  Note `Nlog α ≤ ewN α`
(`Nlog_le_ewN` below: max ≤ sum and `clog n ≤ n`), so `Nlog`'s balls are LARGER than `ewN`'s —
domination does NOT transfer finiteness (wrong direction).  Finite-fiberedness instead follows
from a self-referential induction: any `α` with `Nlog α ≤ K` (for `K ≥ 1`) has EVERY CNF
exponent `e` satisfying `Nlog e ≤ K - 1` (since each leading charge `Nlog e + clog n ≤ K` with
`clog n ≥ 1`), so all exponents are drawn from the finite set `{e : Nlog e ≤ K-1}` and, being
strictly decreasing in the CNF, the tail lives strictly below the head exponent; the
mechanized proof (`Nlog_finite_fiber` below, PROVEN) runs a well-founded induction on the
`NFBelow` bound ordinal inside an induction on `K`.

The DECISIVE contrast with the failure mode `ewN` was built to avoid: the E–W max-coefficient
source norm `‖·‖` is CONSTANT `= 1` on the whole tower spine `ω, ω^ω, ω^{ω^ω}, …` (infinite
fiber at `1`).  `Nlog` GROWS on that spine (`Nlog (t_k) = k+1`), kernel-checked below. -/

/-- `Nlog` is dominated by `ewN` (max ≤ sum, `clog n ≤ n`).  Recorded to make explicit that

Over ALL of `ONote` (non-NF included) the fiber `{α : Nlog α ≤ 1}` is INFINITE: the flat
chains `oadd 0 1 (oadd 0 1 (… 0))` are pairwise distinct notations, all with `Nlog = 1`
(each layer charges `max (Nlog 0 + clog 1) · = max 1 ·`).  So property (i) must be read on
NF notations — which is the only population the calculus ever feeds the norm (`ewBall`'s
clients are all NF).  Kernel-checked below (`Nlog_fiber_infinite_without_NF`). -/

/-- **Finite fibers of `Nlog` on NF notations** — every NF `Nlog`-ball is finite.
(Property (i) of the ruling candidate, fully mechanized; the NF restriction is forced,
see `Nlog_fiber_infinite_without_NF`.)

Proof: induction on `K`.  `K = 0`: the fiber is `{0}` (`clog n ≥ 1`).  `K+1`: inner
well-founded induction on the `NFBelow` bound ordinal `b` — any `oadd e n a` in the
`NFBelow · b` fiber has exponent `e` in the (finite, by outer IH) `Nlog ≤ K` NF-fiber
with `repr e < b`, coefficient `< 2^(K+2)`, and tail in the `NFBelow · (repr e)` fiber
(finite by inner IH, `repr e < b`); so the fiber is covered by a finite union of images.
The strict exponent descent of NF is exactly what the inner ordinal induction consumes —
this is where the flat-chain counterexample is excluded. -/

/-! ## The general absorbing theorem

`Nlog (α + γ) ≤ max (Nlog α) (Nlog γ) + 1` for all NF `α, γ`.

PROOF STRATEGY (the single-merge-boundary argument; see the docstring's TRILEMMA discussion):
induct on `α`.  `α = oadd e n a`, `w := a + γ`, IH `Nlog w ≤ max (Nlog a)(Nlog γ) + 1`.
`α + γ = addAux e n w`; case on `cmp e (head-exponent w)`:
  * `lt`/`w = 0`: result is `w` or `oadd e n 0`, both `≤ max + 1` directly.
  * `gt`: result `oadd e n w`, `max (Nlog e + clog n) (Nlog w) ≤ max (Nlog α) (max+1) = max+1`.
  * `eq` (the merge): result `oadd e (n+n') a'` with `oadd e' n' a' = w`, `e = e'`.  The KEY
    fact that avoids compounding the two `+1`s: the leading term `e'` of `w = a + γ` must be a
    term of **γ** (all of `a`'s exponents are `< e = e'` since `α` is NF), so
    `Nlog e' + clog n' ≤ Nlog γ` (NOT `≤ Nlog w`, which carries the IH `+1`).  Then
    `Nlog e + clog (n+n') ≤ Nlog e + max (clog n)(clog n') + 1 ≤ max (Nlog α)(Nlog γ) + 1` via
    `clog_add_le`, and `Nlog a' ≤ Nlog w ≤ max + 1`.

The absorption `x + γ = γ` (when `x`'s exponents are all below γ's head) COLLAPSES the merge
sub-case (`a + γ = γ`), so the two `+1`s never compound.  PROVEN below (kernel-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). -/

/-- **The general absorbing theorem** (all NF `α, γ`): `Nlog (α+γ) ≤ max (Nlog α)(Nlog γ) + 1`.
Induct on `α`; compare the two leading exponents via `lt_trichotomy` on `repr e`, `repr eg`.
`lt`: α is absorbed (`α+γ = γ`).  `gt`: α's head is prepended (`α+γ = oadd e n (a+γ)`), IH on `a`.
`eq`: the merge — but `a+γ = γ` (absorption, `a`'s exps `< e = eg`), so `α+γ = oadd e (n+ng) ag`

/-! ## Node-gate consequence (the (ii)→gate reduction)

If `Nlog` (or any absorbing norm with constant `c`) is used, the node gate
`N (α+γ) ≤ g (f 0)` closes from `N α ≤ g 0`, `N γ ≤ f 0` WITHOUT `hg_base`, needing only the
weak slack `max (g 0) (f 0) + c ≤ g (f 0)`. -/
